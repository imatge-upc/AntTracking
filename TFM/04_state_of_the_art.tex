\section{State of the art}

{
    The state of the art section has been divided in four parts:
}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first part is about tracking models from the literature, the main foundation of this project.
    \item The second part roughly describes the YOLOv8n model, the detection model.
    \item The third part roughly describes the Bag of Tricks, the appearance model.
    \item The fourth part is about existing software for ant tracking, different implementations of the first part models.
\end{enumerate}
