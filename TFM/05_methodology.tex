    This section offers an in-depth exploration of the research framework, 
    starting with a high-level overview of the project's key components. 
    The research project encompasses three core components:
}

\begin{itemize}
    \item {
        \textbf{Detection}: 
        This component focuses on the initial step of locating ants within video frames. 
        It plays a fundamental role in the subsequent stages of re-identification and tracking. 
        It requires a reasonable amount of labeled image data.
    }
    \item {
        \textbf{Re-identification (ReID)}: 
        ReID is the aspect of the research involving the identification of previously detected ants through visual features. 
        It aims to associate ants with their unique visual identities as they move throughout the video, 
        highlighting the case where ants disappear for a long period. 
        It demands a substantial number of labeled identities for a significant volume of cropped detection images.
    }
    \item {
        \textbf{Tracking}:
        The tracking component is the culmination of the research framework, 
        combining detection and re-identification to trace the ants trajectories across time. 
        The contemplated approches need few labeled video data to test its performance.
    }
\end{itemize}

{
    This high-level system architecture, as well as the requiered resources, inputs and outputs, is depicted in the Figure \ref{fig:block_diagram}. 
    Additionally, the three components have their own performance measurments and metrics.

        Following the research framework and system overview, the methodology section is structured into five subsections:
    }
    
    \nopagebreak

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            \textbf{Data and Datasets}: 
            This subsection details the gathered data and the methodologies used for labeling the ants for the different tasks.
        }
        \item {
            \textbf{Metrics}:
            This subsection comprehensively presents the performance metrics and criteria used to assess the performance of the detection (mAP), re-identification (rank-N), and tracking models (HOTA).
        }
        \item {
            \textbf{Detection model}:
            This subsection explores the specifics of both an initial deductive model and the chosen detection model, including their implementation, training processes (for the chosen model), and key considerations.
        }
        \item {
            \textbf{Appearance model}:
            This subsection delves into the specificities of the appearance model including the implementation, training process and key considerations.
        }
        \item {
            \textbf{Tracking}:
            Finally, we explore the tracking component, were detection, re-identification, 
            motion estimation and location metrics are integrated into a cohesive system for continuous multiple ants tracking.
        }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{samepage}

{
    Each subsection corresponds to a critical aspect of the research and is discussed in detail.
}

{
    The software development took place within a Python 3.10.12 environment on a Ubuntu (Linux) platform. 
    Access to the codebase of this project is available through the GitHub repository link\footnote{\url{https://github.com/imatge-upc/AntTracking/tree/Ignasi}}.
