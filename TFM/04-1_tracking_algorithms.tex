    \ac{MOT} is a branch of computer vision which deals with sequences of images.
    The goal of \ac{MOT} is the location and consistent identification of all the target objects within the sequence.
    
    Currently, there are three strategies to solve this problem:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Detection-Free Tracking}: This strategy involves manually initializing targets, and the models search for these targets in the subsequent frames.
              However, it is not contemplated for this project due to the drawbacks of manual initialization and the inability of increasing the number of identities.
        \item \textit{Tracking by Detection}: In this approach, each frame undergoes an object detection step, followed by an identity association step.
        \item \textit{End-to-End Tracking}: This strategy aims to detect identities from previous frames or generate new identities within a single step. 
              For example, the MOTR\cite{zeng2021motr} model uses transformers to achieve this. 
              However, it requires a substantial amount of data and is not within the scope of this project.
    \end{itemize}

    This subsection provides a review of a family of \textbf{tracking by detection} algorithms that follow the structure introduced by \textbf{\ac{SORT}} (see Figure \ref{fig:cronologia_sort}).
