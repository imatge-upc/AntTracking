    \ac{BYTE}\cite{zhang2022bytetrack}, published in 2021, builds upon the SORT model with a two-staged associator and a deeper detector (YOLOX-X\cite{ge2021yolox}).

\paragraph{Associator}

{
    The two-staged associator divides \textbf{high confidence detections} from \textbf{low confidence detections}, 
    allowing for \textbf{different assignment criteria}.
    The authors propose either a combination of appearance for the high confidence and \ac{IoU} for the low confidence or \ac{IoU} for both stages.
